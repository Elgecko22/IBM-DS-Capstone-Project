# IBM-DS-Capstone-Project
# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction

**Predicting the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings using historical SpaceX launch data.**

This project combines web scraping, API access, data wrangling, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights into SpaceX’s reusability strategy. It was built as part of the IBM Data Science Capstone, leveraging real-world datasets and end-to-end deployment practices.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether the **first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land** after launch—a critical step in making space travel cost-effective. Accurate predictions support mission planning and cost estimation.
